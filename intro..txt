Computer Vision depends on image and image processing.
Image is a collection of pixels.
Pixel is the smallest unit of image which contain color value and every pixel defines the color intensity in an image.
To create a good image, we need minimum 300 PPI(Pixel per inch).
Dots per inch  is a measure of spatial printing, video or image scanner dot density, in particular the number of individual dots that can be placed in a line within the span of 1 inch (2.54 cm). 300 DPI means 300 Dots in 1 inch.
Video is a collection of images.
Image processing is a method to perform some operation on an image, in order to get an enhanced image or to extract some useful information from it.
Computer Vision is a sub part of Artificial Intelligence.
Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary scientific feild that delas how a computer can gain high level understanding from digital images and videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understnad and automate tasks that a human visual system do.

OpenCV - It is an open source library for the implementation of Image Processing and Computer Vision.
In OpenCV, we use array to store an image and numpy library is used to handle array.
Image is always stored in 2D array.
There are two types of images - 
1) Gray scaled images(Single Channel images) - Depends on darkness or brightness
2) Colored images(3 Channel images) - Depends on RGB(RED, GREEN, BLUE)
